Spunk
-----

Splunk provides administrators with the ability to upload custom applications.

Splunk also provides the ability to define custom scripts written in 
python or perl.

Splunk runs as root by default.

What could possibly go wrong?

This tool automates the process of gaining a reverse tcp shell on a Splunk
instance. At the moment this only works on the free version which does
not require authentication and by default logs you in as an admin.

I'll sort out a version for Enterprise at some point soon. Maybe. :-)
